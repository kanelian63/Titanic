# Goal of Project
Predict Kaggle Titanic Survival by Machine Learning. In particular, it solves the problem of missing values by predicting columns with many missing values by machine learning. https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

# Details
In general, it is advantageous to delete a column with many missing values as training data of the model. However, I tried to solve the missing value problem by predicting the missing value by machine learning and filling in the value.

# How to run
All source code is in Titanic.py and you can run it as an available program.

# Results
The results were not good. It was confirmed that applying the predicted value to the predictive model was not efficient.
