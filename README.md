# Goal of Project
Predict Kaggle Titanic Survival by Machine Learning. In particular, it solves the problem of missing values by predicting columns with many missing values by machine learning. https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

# Details
In general, it is advantageous to delete a column with many missing values as training data of the model. However, I tried to solve the missing value problem by predicting the missing value by machine learning and filling in the value.

# How to run
Just open Titanic.py and run it as a program that you can handle.
